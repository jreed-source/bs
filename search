  <h2 id="Hives">Hives</h2><l style="font-size: 22px">
  <body> Hives are the homes of bees. The most common hives beekeepers use are langstroth hives.
  In a langstroth hive you have a bottom board followed by a box containing frames where the bees will lay eggs and replinish the hive.
  This is known as the brood chamber. Next is the queen excluder which allows workers to pass through but not the queen which ensures that no eggs get layed in the honey you will harvest. Any box above this is known as a super or honey super.
  In each box you have frames which are either open or have a premade foundation to help the bees get started. Below are good pages about hives.

  <body> Many types of bees are used in beekeeping. All types have different advantages and disadvantages. Many honey bees are simply sub species of the Western Honey Bee.
  Italians are one the most common used for beekeeping of this sub species and are known for their calm temperment and productivity. For more information click species of bees below. In a hive you will find 3 types of bees works, drones, and a queen.
  Workers are smaller and will be the ones leaving the hive. Drones are larger than workers and stay inside the hive. The queen will be large with a distinctly pointed thorax. For more info click types of bees in a hive below.

  <body> A Beekeeper uses many types of gear the main ones you will see are the suit and smoker. You also will use your hive tool and bee brush for taking frames out.
  Once you have frames out you will need an extractor and uncapping tool. Click information on tools for more info.
