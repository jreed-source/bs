  <body> Hives are the homes of bees. The most common hives beekeepers use are langstroth hives.
  In a langstroth hive you have a bottom board followed by a box containing frames where the bees will lay eggs and replinish the hive.
  This is known as the brood chamber. Next is the queen excluder which allows workers to pass through but not the queen which ensures that no eggs get layed in the honey you will harvest. Any box above this is known as a super or honey super.
